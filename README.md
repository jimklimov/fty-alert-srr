# fty-template

This is just a template for agent repository in a 42ITy ecosystem.

## How to create your agent

To create your agent, you have to specify this template when creating
a repository on github.

Then you have to update the project.xml and license.xml files, and
run from the local clone of your repository the tool ProjectXML from
the repo FTY:

```bash
../FTY/ProjectXML -A
```

Then you can add all the files needed: Example with generation of the template:

```bash
	doc/fty-template.adoc
	include/fty_template.h
	include/fty_template_class_example.h
	include/fty_template_library.h
	packaging/debian/fty-template.dsc.obs
	packaging/redhat/fty-template.spec
	src/fty_template_class_example.cc
	src/fty_template_classes.h
	src/fty_template_private_selftest.cc
	src/fty_template_selftest.cc
	src/libfty_template.pc.in
```

If you try building before committing the changes, be sure to NOT add the
final files generated by autotools, such as the configure script and its
aclocal.m4 and config/*.m4 components, or the Makefile.in files.

See existing components, such as fty-example, for recommended content and
structure of the README of a realistic codebase.
